I'm a big fan of rice. If you're reading this, chances are you are too. This is my recipe for cooking rice which has never failed me. You will end up with delicious rice that won't stick to your pot!

**Notes:**
- Rice normally needs around 1.5 to 2 times its volume in water. Meaning if you are using 1 cup of rice, you'll need between 1.5 to 2 cups of water.
- Seasoning rice with vegetables is optional, and your preference. I like garlic and onion but you'll be fine using just salt.


**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup of rice.
- 2 cups of water.
- Salt and pepper to taste.
- 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped.
- 1 tbsp. of olive oil (could also use canola or butter).

**Preparation:**
- Start by toasting the rice in your pan using your oil or fat. Keep stirring it while toasting to make sure it toasts evenly. You will soon see grains turn **bright white**. If you start seeing grains turn brown, stop the toasting and continue.
- When your rice is mostly toasted, add your water and seasonings.
- Raise the heat to hight. Cover the pot and keep your heat high.
- Keep your eye on the rice, and give it a little nudge/shake to avoid grains sticking to the bottom of the pot.
- Once boiling, turn the heat low **and keep the rice covered**. 
- Let the rice simmer for 20 minutes. After the time is done, turn off the heat.
- Let your rice **rest covered for 5 to 8 minutes.** Don't skip this step!
- Uncover your rice, transfer to your bowl and use a fork or a spoon to fluff and toss the rice.

Enjoy!
