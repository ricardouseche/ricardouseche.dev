It's 2021. Everything is connected to the internet. Data is collected in a multitude of ways, all of the time. Your fridge just pushed a notification about milk running out.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a large network of internet-connected devices that possess the capability of gathering and sharing . Year after year the list of *things* that make up this network grows and now you are able to buy a variety of items with these capabilities. Yes, even a fridge. 

However, on the other end of the spectrum, we've got devices like microcontrollers that are the size of a stick of gum, yet pack a powerful feature set. One of these is the [ESP8266](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266), which brings Wi-Fi, GPIO pins, I2S/I2C   affordable and pleasant to work with package.

The ESP8266 is also one of Google's recommended chips to get started working with [Cloud IoT Core](https://cloud.google.com/iot-core), which is a managed service to easily connect and secure IoT devices.
