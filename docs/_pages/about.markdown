Hi. I'm Ricardo Useche. I currently work at Google as a Developer Relations Engineer for our internal server teams.

Previously, I worked at Google as a Solutions Consultant (2020-2021).

This site contains a series of ramblings related to technology, life, cooking, and more. Some of them are lessons I've learned, some other ones are for me to document experiences. Some others are a bit more out there. 

I hope you find something useful from this, as I do.
