Hi. I'm Ricardo Useche. I work at Google as a Solutions Consultant.

This site contains a series of ramblings related to technology, life, cooking, and more. Some of them are lessons I've learned, some other ones are for me to document experiences. Some others are a bit more out there. 

I hope you get something from this too.
