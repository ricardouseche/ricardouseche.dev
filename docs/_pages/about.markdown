Hi. I'm Ricardo Useche. I'm originally from Venezuela, but currently reside in New York City. I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Houston, obtaining a B.S. in Computer Science.

I was fortunate enough to complete a few internships during this time, exploring areas like data science, full stack engineering, and IoT. I hold interest in a variety of things and every once in a while launch small, personal projects. This site is one them.

ricardouseche.dev contains a series of ramblings related to technology, life, cooking, and more. My goal is to use the site to become better at writing, while also documenting my experiences with things. I hope you find something useful from this, as I do.

I currently work at Google as a Developer Relations Engineer, and contribute to the adoption and development of our internal server platform.

Previously, I worked at Google as a Solutions Consultant (2020-2021).
